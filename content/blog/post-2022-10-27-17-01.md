# Creating GPG finger print

Sysinfo:
```
Kernel: 5.13.0-27-generic x86_64 
Bits: 64 Desktop: Unity 
Distro: Ubuntu 20.04.3 LTS (Focal Fossa)
```
First of all we need to get gpg2 package.

```
sudo apt install gpg2
```

Version:
```
gpg (GnuPG) 2.2.19
```
To generate the key:

```
gpg --full-generate-key
```
After follwing instruction from the cli I got this:

```
pub   rsa4096 2022-01-27 [SC] [expires: 2023-01-27]
      638024340EBA291A1B0B7C0AEDCEBB4AB7C11242
uid   Yevhen Yakubovskyi (signing deb package for further placement on github) <yaievgeniy@gmail.com>
sub   rsa4096 2022-01-27 [E] [expires: 2023-01-27]
```

To check if key was generated:

```
gpg --list-secret-keys --keyid-format=long
```

Now I will add GPG key to github followinf this [link][].
